# Basic-Sound-Data-Analysis
This Repository demonstrates the basic data analysis of sound. Using the threshold based audio recording /n

** audio_record.py  --> ** This python code is used to record audio files. This code records the audio only when the rms crosses the threshold value. For proper analysis this code records the audio till the time it is more than threshold rms or for atleast 1 second (which ever is bigger). For each recording it also stores the rms value and the timestamp in the csv file('rms_timestamp.csv')

** Audio Analysis.ipynb --> ** Demonstratest the descriptive basic data analysis that can be performed on audio data.

** 1464778410.7.wav and 1464794032.98.wav --> ** these are the sample recordings for which the data analysis is shown in "Audio Analysis.ipynb" file
